ANSIBLE = Automation
It is owned by red hat . If we have one system and we wanna install some package to we can manage it easily since its only one machine . what if we have ten machines it will be 
a problem . Because  we have to install this in all ten machines . But by using ansible we can automat the process. By using ansible we can make one machine server as control
server or master server and then control all the other servers . we  can automat the process by giving command or doing the process we want in only one server .
Ansible is not the only tool which perform this process but it is easiest tool to handle.
          It is python based and is agentless i.e. if we want to automat by using other tools we should install some agent in all the systems or servers we have manually . But here 
in ansible it simply connects with other systems with SSH and runs commands. It is an open source. It has PUSH configuration ..
